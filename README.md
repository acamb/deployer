A secure SSH-based deployment system for remote Docker container management.

Deployer is designed for homelabs and small infrastructure setups where you need simple, secure Docker deployments without the complexity of setting up a Docker registry. Instead of managing registry infrastructure, Deployer transfers Docker images directly from your development machine to the target server over SSH, making it perfect for personal projects, small teams, and homelab environments.

## Features

- **Docker Integration**: Deploy and manage Docker containers remotely: deploy, start, stop, and view logs
- **Secure Communication**: All data encrypted over SSH channels, public key authentication and host key verification

## Architecture

The system consists of two components:
- **Server**: SSH server that manages Docker containers
- **Client**: CLI tool for deployment and container management

## How It Works

Deployer simplifies Docker deployments using just two files in your project directory:

### Project Files
- **`Dockerfile`** *(optional)*: Client builds the Docker image locally
- **`compose.yml`** *(required)*: Server uses this to orchestrate the container

### Deployment Process
1. **`deployer-client deploy`**: Builds image (if Dockerfile exists), packages everything, and sends to server via SSH
2. **Server**: Receives the image and compose file, imports the image, then uses `docker-compose` to manage the container

### Remote Management
All container operations (`start`, `stop`, `restart`, `logs`) are executed on the server using docker-compose commands. Communication is secured through SSH with public key authentication.

### Deployment Options
- **With Dockerfile**: Full build and deploy - client builds image locally and transfers it
- **Compose only**: Use existing images from registries - faster for updates using pre-built images

## Server Setup - Debian Package Installation (Recommended)

### 1. Download and Install Package

```bash
# Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/your-username/deployer/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/deployer-server_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb

# Install the package
sudo apt install /path/to/deployer-server_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb
```

The package automatically:
- Creates `deployer-server` system user
- Sets up systemd service
- Creates working directory `/opt/deployer`
- Generates SSH host key at `/opt/deployer/host_rsa_key`
- Adds user to docker group
- Starts the service

### 2. Add Client Public Keys

```bash
# Add client public keys to authorized_keys (one per line)
sudo -u deployer-server tee -a /opt/deployer/authorized_keys <<< "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQC..."
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check server is running
sudo systemctl status deployer-server

# Check server is listening
ss -tlnp | grep :7676

# Verify file permissions
ls -la /opt/deployer/authorized_keys  # Should be 600
ls -la /opt/deployer/host_rsa_key     # Should be 600

# Test SSH connection (optional)
ssh -p 7676 deployer@localhost
```

### 4. Service Management

```bash
# Restart service after configuration changes
sudo systemctl restart deployer-server

# Stop/start service
sudo systemctl stop deployer-server
sudo systemctl start deployer-server

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u deployer-server -f
```

- Owner: same user running the server (`deployer-server`)
- Format: one public key per line (OpenSSH standard format)

## Client Setup - Debian Package Installation (Recommended)

### 1. Download and Install Package

```bash
# Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/your-username/deployer/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/deployer-client_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb

# Install the package
sudo apt install /path/to/deployer-client_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb
```

The package automatically:
- Installs `deployer-client` binary in `/usr/bin/`

### 2. Configure Client

Create a configuration file for each project / deployment:

```bash
# Create configuration file
nano client-config.yaml
```

Example configuration:

```yaml
host: your-server-host
port: 7676
name: myapp
image_name: myapp:latest
#the private key is optional, by default the user keys are used.
private_key: /path/to/your/private/key
```

### 3. Generate SSH Key Pair (if needed)

If you don't have an SSH key pair, create one:

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair for client authentication
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/deployer_key -N ""

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deployer_key
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/deployer_key.pub
```

### 4. Authorize Client on Server

Add your public key to the server's authorized_keys:

```bash
# Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/deployer_key.pub
# Add this key to server's /opt/deployer/authorized_keys file
```

---

## Client Setup - Manual Installation

### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair (optional, you can use existing keys)

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair for client authentication
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/deployer_key -N ""

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deployer_key
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/deployer_key.pub
```

### 2. Authorize Client on Server

Copy the client's public key to the server's `authorized_keys` file:

```bash
# Method 1: Manual copy (most common)
cat ~/.ssh/deployer_key.pub
# Copy the output and add it to server's /opt/deployer/authorized_keys

# Method 2: Using scp
scp ~/.ssh/deployer_key.pub user@server-host:/tmp/
# Then on server: sudo -u deployer-server tee -a /opt/deployer/authorized_keys < /tmp/deployer_key.pub
```

### 3. Create Client Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file (e.g., `client-config.yaml`) for each project or deployment:

```yaml
host: your-server-host
port: 7676
name: myapp
image_name: myapp:latest
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **host**: Deployer server hostname or IP address
- **port**: Deployer server port (default: 7676)
- **name**: Unique deployment identifier
- **image_name**: Docker image name to deploy

### 4. Build Client (if needed)

```bash
# If you built the server manually, the client is already built
# Otherwise, build just the client:
git clone https://github.com/acamb/deployer.git
cd deployer
make client  # Creates bin/deployer-client
```

## Usage

You must run the client from the project / deployment directory where you place your `compose.yml` and (optionally) `Dockerfile` files.
The `deploy` command will build the Docker image and will send the image and the compose.yml file to the server.
The server will use the compose.yml file to deploy and manage the container.

### Client Operations

```bash
deployer-client deploy                 # Deploy application
deployer-client start myapp            # Start container
deployer-client stop myapp             # Stop container
deployer-client restart myapp          # Restart container
deployer-client logs myapp             # View container logs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

```bash
# Verify public key is in server's authorized_keys
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deployer_key deployer@server-host -p 7676

# Check server logs for authentication errors (package installation)
sudo journalctl -u deployer-server -f

# Check server logs for authentication errors (manual installation)
tail -f /var/log/deployer.log
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Check key permissions on client
ls -la ~/.ssh/deployer_key*
# Should be: 600 for private key, 644 for public key

# Check authorized_keys permissions on server
ssh server-host "ls -la /opt/deployer/authorized_keys"
# Should be: 600
```
